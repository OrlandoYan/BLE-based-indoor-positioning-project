# BLE-based-indoor-positioning
The code pertains to BLE indoor positioning. In our project, we conceived an idea to integrate the IoT scenario into hospitals. This would enhance connectivity among patients, hospital staff, and medical assets. Valuable information like location, temperature, humidity, posture, and emotions of individuals can be seamlessly shared and accessed. With such a system in place, we can eliminate concerns like patients and doctors being unaware of each other's real-time locations. Moreover, doctors can remotely monitor patients' physical conditions. Should any issues arise, timely interventions can be made. The code comprises both Tag and Anchor parts. The tag refers to the device attached to an individual whose position we want to determine. In this project, I employed two strategies for indoor positioning: the first utilizes a logarithmic fading propagation model combined with a filter algorithm for triangulation-based positioning. The second leverages an RSSI comparison algorithm for room-level positioning.
