# BLE-indoor-positioning
It's the code of BLE indoor positionig
In our project, we have make an idea, whether if we can apply IoT scenario into hospital 
to better connect patients, hospital crews and medical assets together. The valuable 
information, such as location, thermal, humidity, posture and emotion, etc, of them can 
be easily accessed from each other. In this case, we will not worry about some issues 
such as, the patient and doctor do not know the real time locations of themselves or 
each other. Also, the doctor can remotely monitor the patientsâ€™ physical conditions, and 
when there is some problem happen, they can take action timely. 
The code includes Tag and Anchor part, the tag is the device attached to the person to whom
we want to know his or her position.
In this project, I have used two scenarios to achieve the indoor positioning, the first one
is based on logarithmic fading propagation model with filter algorithm to achieve the 
triangular indoor positioning, the second one is by using a RSSI comparing alogrithm to
achieve the room level positioning.
